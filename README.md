# First_Android_Game_SubHunter
This is my first app of the android app journey. This is a simple GUI game named as SubHunter. 
In the game as the player taps on the screen it shows the distance of the sub from the point the 
player pressed . By navigating through the indicating text on the screen the player has to find the actual 
position of the sub. As you find the sub , a BOOM word reflects on the screen .
